\title{Health Care Effect with Continuation Probability}
\usage{
hc_effect(x, prb_of_continuation, pid)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An integer vector representing health care effect status (1 = present, 0 = absent).
Must be sorted by year/time within person.}

\item{prb_of_continuation}{A numeric value representing the probability of effect continuation}

\item{pid}{A logical vector marking new person IDs (TRUE for new person, FALSE otherwise).
Data must be grouped by person and sorted by year/time.}
}
\value{
An integer vector with updated health care effect status
}
\description{
Models the continuation of a health care effect based on a probability of continuation.
When the previous time step had the effect (value 1) and it's not a new person,
a binomial trial determines if the effect continues.
}
\details{
**Important**: The input data must be grouped by person ID and sorted by year/time within each person.
This ensures proper temporal sequencing for modeling effect continuation.

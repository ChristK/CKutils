\title{Simplified loading and installing of packages}
\usage{
dependencies(
  ...,
  pkges = NULL,
  install = TRUE,
  update = FALSE,
  quiet = TRUE,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Package names (quoted or unquoted) or a character vector of package names.
When providing unquoted names, separate them with commas.
When providing a character vector, it should be the first argument.}

\item{pkges}{(Deprecated) Use \code{...} instead. A character vector with the names of the packages to load.}

\item{install}{Logical. If TRUE (default), any packages not already installed will be installed.}

\item{update}{Logical. If TRUE, this function will install a newer version of the
package if available. Default is FALSE.}

\item{quiet}{Logical. If TRUE (default), package startup messages will be suppressed.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, diagnostic messages will be printed. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
a data frame with four columns and rownames corresponding to the
        packages to be loaded. The four columns are: loaded (logical
        indicating whether the package was successfully loaded), installed
        (logical indicating that the package was installed or updated),
        loaded.version (the version string of the installed package), and
        available.version (the version string of the package currently
        available on CRAN). Note that this only reflects packages listed in
        the \code{...} parameter. Other packages may be loaded and/or
        installed as necessary by \code{install.packages} and \code{require}.
        If \code{verbose=FALSE} the data frame will be returned using
        \code{\link{invisible}}.
}
\description{
This is a wrapper to \code{\link{require}} and \code{\link{install.packages}}.
Specifically, this will first try to load the package(s) and if not found
it will install then load and attach the packages. Additionally, if the
\code{update=TRUE} parameter is specified it will check the currently
installed package version with what is available on CRAN (or mirror) and
install the newer version.

\details{
The function was originally created by Jason Bryer
\href{https://www.r-bloggers.com/2014/02/function-to-simplify-loading-and-installing-packages/}{here}
and the source is available \href{https://gist.github.com/jbryer/9112634}{here}.
Note: I renamed the function to \code{dependencies} and adapted it to attach
instead of only load the packages.

\dontrun{
# Using unquoted package names
dependencies(data.table, MASS, ggplot2)

# Using quoted package names (traditional way)
dependencies(c('data.table','MASS'))

# Mixed usage with options
dependencies(data.table, MASS, install = TRUE, quiet = FALSE)

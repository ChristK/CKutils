\title{Carry Forward Values in an Integer Vector}
\usage{
carry_forward(x, pid_mrk, y, byref)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An integer vector to process (must be sorted by year/time within person)}

\item{pid_mrk}{A logical vector marking new person IDs (TRUE for new person, FALSE otherwise).
Data must be grouped by person and sorted by year/time.}

\item{y}{The integer value to carry forward}

\item{byref}{Logical; if TRUE, modifies `x` in place, if FALSE returns a new vector}
}
\value{
An integer vector with values carried forward according to the rules
}
\description{
Propagates a specific value forward through an integer vector based on person ID markers.
When the previous element equals the target value and the current position is not a new person,
the target value is carried forward to the current position.
}
\details{
**Important**: The input data must be grouped by person ID and sorted by year/time within each person.
This ensures proper temporal ordering for the carry-forward operation.

**Missing Values**: Missing values (NA) in the input vectors are handled gracefully. Positions
with missing person ID markers or values are skipped during processing, preserving existing values.

\title{Carry Values Backward with Decrementation}
\usage{
carry_backward_decr(x, pid_mrk, y = 0L)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An integer vector to process (must be sorted by year/time within person)}

\item{pid_mrk}{A logical vector marking new person IDs (TRUE for new person, FALSE otherwise).
Data must be grouped by person and sorted by year/time.}

\item{y}{The threshold value for backward propagation}
}
\value{
An integer vector with values carried backward and decremented
}
\description{
Propagates values backward through an integer vector, decrementing values as it goes.
The function processes the vector from end to beginning, reducing values by 1 when
moving backward, respecting person ID boundaries.
}
\details{
**Important**: The input data must be grouped by person ID and sorted by year/time within each person.
This ensures proper temporal ordering for the backward propagation operation.

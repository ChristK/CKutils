\title{Create New Simulant Markers}
\usage{
mk_new_simulant_markers(pid)
}
\arguments{
\item{pid}{An integer vector of person IDs (must be grouped by person and sorted by year/time)}
}
\value{
A logical vector where TRUE indicates the start of a new simulant
}
\description{
Creates a logical vector marking the positions where new simulants (persons) begin
based on changes in person ID values. The first position is always marked as TRUE.
This function is optimised for performance with minimal branching and memory access.
}
\details{
**Important**: The input data must be grouped by person ID and sorted by year/time within each person.
This ensures correct identification of person boundaries in temporal data.

**Missing Values**: Missing values (NA) in person IDs are treated as new simulants.
Each NA value will be marked as TRUE (start of new simulant).

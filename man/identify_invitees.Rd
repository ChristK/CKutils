\usage{
identify_invitees(elig, prev_inv, prb, freq, pid)
}
\arguments{
\item{elig}{An integer vector indicating eligibility (1 = eligible, 0 = not eligible).
Must be sorted by year/time within person.}

\item{prev_inv}{An integer vector indicating previous invitations (1 = previously invited, 0 = not).
Must be sorted by year/time within person.}

\item{prb}{A numeric vector of invitation probabilities for each individual.
Must be sorted by year/time within person.}

\item{freq}{An integer vector of minimum years between invitations for each individual.
Must be sorted by year/time within person.}

\item{pid}{A logical vector marking new person IDs (TRUE for new person, FALSE otherwise).
Data must be grouped by person and sorted by year/time.}
}
\value{
An integer vector where 1 indicates an invitation should be sent, 0 otherwise, NA for missing inputs
}
\description{
Determines which eligible individuals should be invited to screening programs
based on eligibility, invitation frequency, probabilities, and previous invitations.
The function respects minimum intervals between invitations and person ID boundaries.
}
\details{
**Important**: The input data must be grouped by person ID and sorted by year/time within each person.
This ensures proper tracking of invitation intervals and temporal relationships.

**Missing Values**: Missing values (NA) in any of the input vectors result in NA output
for that position, ensuring data integrity in the screening process.

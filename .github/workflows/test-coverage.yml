# Test Coverage Workflow for CKutils R Package
# =============================================================================
#
# This workflow measures code coverage for the CKutils package and uploads
# results to Codecov for tracking coverage trends and pull request analysis.
#
# Workflow triggers:
# - Push to main/master branches
# - Pull requests to main/master branches
#
# Coverage process:
# 1. Installs package with dependencies in a temporary location
# 2. Runs all tests while measuring code coverage using the 'covr' package
# 3. Uploads coverage results to Codecov for analysis and reporting
# 4. Provides coverage reports in pull requests
#
# The workflow runs on Ubuntu with the latest R release for consistency.
# Coverage results help maintain code quality and identify untested code paths.
#
# Codecov integration provides:
# - Coverage percentage tracking over time
# - Pull request coverage diff reporting  
# - Identification of uncovered lines
# - Coverage trends and analytics
#
# Workflow derived from https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2/examples
